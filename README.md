# Coordinate-Finder
You enter your coordinates of your location and it shows your city via Google Map API. It gets GPS coordinates of your device when you
click on nearest city. You click left on map, then it shows your distance to the earth center. I used free trial of Google Maps API. Due 
to limited sources you may not acces nearest city and elevation option.
